## Projects
### [Project 1: Classification Model to Predict and Employee's Resignation](https://github.com/cwdwiggins/DS602/blob/main/midterm/DATA_602_Midterm_Notebook.ipynb)
- Performed exploratory data analysis to uncover factors contributing to an employee's resignation using Python and data visualization packages such as Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Developed a pre-processing data pipeline to clean and prepare numerical and categorical features for modeling
- Compared performance of logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest models based on their F1-score for predicting an employeeâ€™s resignation and used cross-validation to identify optimal hyperparameters
- Selected a final model and evaluated its performance on training and testing data by creating a confusion matrix and a Reciever Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve

### [Project 2: Flight Price Prediction Using Regression in R](https://cwdwiggins.github.io/Flight-Price-Project/)
- Obtained a dataset from Kaggle.com that contained information on flight details and fares in India
- Performed exploratory data analysis to analyze and derive features for modeling and identified four features for use in the model
- Built linear regression, random forest regression, and decision tree regression models and manually calculated their R-squared values for performance comparison
- Experimented with explanatory variable interactions and how they affected model performance
- Selected a best performing model and created diagnostic plots for easier understanding of the model's effectiveness  <br>

### [Project 3: Pokemon Type Classification Using Pokemon Stats in R](https://cwdwiggins.github.io/Pokemon-Stats-Project/)
- Used a Kaggle.com dataset that contained information on Pokemon six Pokemon stats to predict the type of Pokemon based off two stats only
- Determined two candidate stats and build Decision Tree, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest models for comparison
- Created more granular labels based off initial modeling results to attempt a higher model accuracy
- Re-built the models, analyzed performance, and identified next steps for greater improvement
