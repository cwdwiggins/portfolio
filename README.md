## Projects
### [Project 1: Flight Price Prediction Using Regression in R](https://cwdwiggins.github.io/Flight-Price-Project/)
- Obtained a dataset from Kaggle.com that contained information on flight details and fares in India
- Performed exploratory data analysis to analyze and derive features for modeling and identified four features for use in the model
- Built linear regression, random forest regression, and decision tree regression models and manually calculated their R-squared values for performance comparison
- Experimented with explanatory variable interactions and how they affected model performance
- Selected a best performing model and created diagnostic plots for easier understanding of the model's effectiveness  <br>
